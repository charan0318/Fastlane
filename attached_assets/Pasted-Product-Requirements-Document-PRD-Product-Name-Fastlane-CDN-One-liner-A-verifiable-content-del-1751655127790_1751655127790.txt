Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Product Name

Fastlane CDN

One-liner

A verifiable content delivery network for Web3, powered by Filecoin PDP storage and FilCDN edge retrieval.

Summary

Fastlane CDN is a decentralized SaaS platform enabling developers to upload and deliver frontend application assets (HTML, JS, CSS, media, 3D models, JSON) using Filecoin Proof of Data Possession (PDP) storage contracts. These assets are distributed via FilCDN, offering instant, secure, and censorship-resistant delivery from a globally distributed cache.

This MVP targets testnet deployments (Filecoin Calibration via Estuary) and real file uploads with live PDP deals, FilCDN integration, and verifiable delivery links.

Target Users

Web3 frontend developers

NFT dApps and metadata APIs

DePIN and 3D gaming platforms

DAO dashboards / ZK frontend loaders

Protocol landing pages / micro-frontends

MVP Goals (Testnet)

Upload a real asset

Trigger PDP storage deal on Calibration testnet

Serve content via FilCDN (via https://gateway.filcdn.io/ipfs/CID)

Track live PDP proof status from Estuary

Integrate React/JS embed snippets for external use

No mock data, real uploads and status tracking

SCREEN 3: Deal Tracker & PDP Proof Monitor

DealID, CID, status (Active, Sealing, Failed)

Last Verified Timestamp (Estuary PDP API or logs)

FilCDN retrieval status (instant link + open)

Refresh deal status from GET /api/deal/:cid

Polling logic every 60s (via timer)

SCREEN 4: Dashboard / File Manager

List of uploaded files per wallet

Columns: Filename, CID, filCDN URL, PDP Verified?, Uploaded Date

Actions: Copy, Open, View Details

Backend: GET /api/files/:wallet

Combines IndexedDB cache and Estuary deal fetch

SCREEN 5: React Demo Viewer

Embed filCDN URLs into live preview of React app

Render user-uploaded files (logo, images, 3D, etc.) via CDN

Measure load time (performance.now)

Show fallback or warning if CID not resolved

SCREEN 6: Wallet Connect (Global)

RainbowKit or Wagmi Wallet modal

Store address in React context (session scoped)

Gate uploads/dashboard if not connected

Auto-redirect or prompt if disconnected

SCREEN 7: Docs / Help

Explain Calibration testnet, PDP, filCDN flow

Lifecycle Diagram: Upload → PDP → Deal → Proof → CDN → Embed

Code Snippets:

HTML: 

React: const imgUrl = "https://gateway.filcdn.io/ipfs/${cid}"

FAQs: How long is storage? Can I reverify?

Format: Static MDX or Markdown

Backend API Specification

POST /api/upload

Accepts: multipart/form-data

Uploads to Estuary Calibration via PDP=true

Returns: dealId, CID, URL, timestamp

GET /api/deal/:cid

Queries Estuary Calibration endpoint

Returns: dealId, PDP status, lastVerifiedTime

GET /api/files/:wallet

Lists all uploaded CIDs for wallet

Uses Estuary’s /user/uploads or deal list API

External Dependencies

Filecoin Calibration testnet (not Hyperspace)

Estuary (https://docs.estuary.tech/)

FilCDN gateway: https://gateway.filcdn.io

IPFS HTTP client (for fallback pinning)

MetaMask / WalletConnect via wagmi

Deployment Plan

Frontend: Vercel (Next.js or CRA)

Backend: Vercel Serverless or Express API

Use Estuary Token for Calibration network

Full Estuary deal submission on every upload

No DB required in MVP — real-time deal lookups via API

Future Business Layer (Post-MVP)

Paid PDP deals via Calibration or Mainnet

Tiered GB/month + CDN usage

User dashboards with download metrics

Vanity domains for filCDN proxies

Acceptance Criteria

✅ File uploads from browser trigger real Estuary PDP deal on Calibration

✅ PDP proof visible from /deal/:cid endpoint

✅ User can access asset via FilCDN in real time

✅ React app demo loads user asset with performance log

✅ Real files only, no mocks, running end-to-end on Calibration + FilCDN
